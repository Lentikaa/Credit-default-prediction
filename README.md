# Credit-default-prediction
# Introduction
This project develops a robust credit card default prediction system for Bank A to assess and manage credit risk within their existing customer portfolio. The system implements a sophisticated behavior scoring model that predicts the probability of customer defaults
# Project Overview
Uses supervised learning techniques to classify customers as likely to default or not.

Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building.

Implements models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Dataset
The dataset contains features such as income, age, credit balance, and previous payment history.

Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded.
# Explanatory Data Analysis
Distribution of target classes (default vs. non-default).

Correlation analysis to identify important features.

Feature scaling and selection.
# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

XGBoost (Advanced Model)
# Model Performance
Evaluates classification reports and confusion matrices.

Uses AUC-ROC to compare models.

Applies SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
